## hello, world!

I'm Rajdeep Ghosh, 22 years old as of today, a developer from Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

Since childhood, I've been a curious soul, building and breaking stuff, deconstructing toys, and "accidentally" destroying electronic items lying around the house.

My coding journey began at 14 when I wrote calculators and board games in batch on my family's Windows 7 computer.

## school

I studied up to 10th standard at [G.B. Memorial Institution](https://gbmemorial.org), where I had a blast with great friends. I was that kid who was into everything - sports, exhibitions, drama, dance, elocution, and quizzing, spell-bees.

For 12th, I switched to Barisha High School, one of Kolkata's oldest schools founded by [Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishwar_Chandra_Vidyasagar). Here, I made cool friends with whom I bunked classes, partied, jumped into pools, and often got into trouble. From breaking test tubes to sleeping in class - I did it all.

## college

I did my undergrad in Computer Science at [Techno International New Town](https://tint.edu.in). When COVID-19 hit and college went online, I rediscovered my love for programming. During this time, I worked in academic research with my professors and tried solving real-life problems.
I got introduced to linux, broke my a laptop a LOT of times and got addicted to ricing Arch linux.

I also spent a ton of time traveling across India for hackathons and I won a LOT of them along with some smart friends and good memories.

## hobbies

My hobbies? Music, tech, gaming, and traveling. I've been a music junkie forever. Started playing guitar at 15 (borrowed from my brother), then taught myself mandolin, ukulele, harmonica, and Indian flute. As for gaming, let's just say I had an unhealthy addiction since we got our first computer. Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, Half-Life - you name it, I've probably played it.

## career

Currently, I'm an ML engineer at [Vapi (YC W21)](https://vapi.ai), working on cutting-edge AI models and engineering. Before this, I was at [Fourie](https://fourie.ai), developing deep learning models for content localization in Indic languages, including state-of-the-art TTS, ASR, and NLP tools.

## what next?

The plan is simple: keep pushing myself to be the best at what I do. Stay on top of bleeding-edge tech, build cool stuff, and never lose that curiosity and hunger for knowledge. Let's see where this rollercoaster takes me!
