## the big idea

So, after what felt like endless back-and-forth with my buddies about our long-overdue adventure, we finally landed on the Hampta Pass trek. It's a 25km trail on the crossover terrains of the Himalayas; from lush green meadows of Kullu to barren cold desert of Spiti. The guides rate it as easy-to-moderate, and since I already had trekking experiences in my past, it felt a bit too plain for me. I got this brilliant (or maybe not so brilliant) idea: 'Hey, why don't we do this DIY style?' No guides, no porters, just us and the great outdoors. Somehow, I managed to talk my friends into this crazy plan. Before we knew it, we were setting off for Hampta Pass, our backs bent under the weight of our overstuffed rucksacks.

## the prep & journey

We geared up for the trek, buying essentials like hiking shoes, a butane cooking stove, rucksacks, and camping mattresses and renting tents and sleeping bags.
Our journey kicked off with the Duranta Express from Sealdah to New Delhi, leaving at 5 PM and rolling into the capital around 11 AM the next day - a solid 20-hour ride. We killed time exploring New Delhi until 4:30 PM, then hopped on our bus to Manali from Kashmiri Gate at 5 PM.
The bus made a pit stop in Karnal for a quick dinner break, where we had [Dosas](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa_(food)>). The journey resumed and I comfortably fell asleep on the bus. When I woke up, it was around 3:00 AM, and it was raining. I could already see mountains and cliffs in the dimly lit night, and my excitement was off the charts. Finally, we pulled into Manali's private bus stand at the crack of dawn, around 5:30 AM. I arranged for a private car which took us to Sethan, the starting point of our trek.

### the beginning

We reached our starting point at around 9:30 AM, with everyone charged and excited for the adventure. The plan for the first day was to reach Chikka: the first camping site. We were also in a race against time, as we'd booked this ride from Chhatru (that's where the trek ends) to Chandratal, and it was set in stone for 7:00 AM sharp, three days from now. No wiggle room there. If we failed to make this connection, we risked being stranded in Chhatru, a remote location with very limited transportation options.

The terrain was beautiful, green and lush with flower. Although the tent we were carrying was a bit tough to carry in the terrain. We met some folks from Bengaluru, had some good chats and reached Chikka by 11:00 AM.

We still had plenty of time since it would stay light until 8 PM. So, we decided to head to the next site: Balu ka Ghera. This would make our rendezvous at Chhatru easier. However, one of my friends started feeling sick, so we postponed this plan and set up our tents at Chikka instead. We made some coffee and watched the shepherds herd their sheep across the valleys. By 4 PM, our friend felt better, so we decided to push on to the next site, with four hours of daylight still remaining.
