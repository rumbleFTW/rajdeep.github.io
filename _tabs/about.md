# Hi, I'm Rajdeep Ghosh

I'm a 22-year-old ML engineer from Kolkata, India, with an insatiable curiosity for technology and a penchant for building (and occasionally breaking) things.

When I'm not diving into ML models or jamming on my guitar, you'll find me exploring new tech, traveling, or reminiscing about my school days full of mischief and learning.

My mission? To keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible in tech while never losing the childlike wonder that got me started.
